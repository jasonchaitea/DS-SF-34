    "Okay, so you understand regression like a champion, but something tells you that these models are not a cure-all that explain all data. Big data sets are notorious for growing complex and creating extreme explanations for the data they describe. Even if these extreme explantions fit the data better than a simpler model, they are less likely to be  generalized. These models explain data from the past well, but are less likely to explain for future data it has never seen before. This issue, as you probably heard, is called an overfit model.\n",

Our model cannot find any corelation between a pet's characteristics and friendliness. Underfitting is intuitive to catch, just look at the classification accuracy on the training data. If the accuracy is low, the model may be too simple, and therefore underfit. Increase the complexity (the number of paramters in the model), and get a better fit. As we will see, regularization also helps alleviate this problem. \n",

The model complexity causes overfitting by contouring to very small deviations in the data. It turns out that **the size of the coeffient weights, W, increases exponentially with model complexity**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude of the coefficient represents the emphasis we are putting on that feature as a predictor. If we think animal size is important to friendliness, we will give that feature a large weight. When the weight becomes too large, the algorithm starts creating intricate relations to model the output, which is not desireable. Another way to think of it, is that features with large weights can almost signlehandedly control the output prediction. Think about that first model for animal friendliness (the dumb one). \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization is a technique to optimize model fit, most commonly to prevent overfitting. It works by penalizing the weights matrix, W, based on the size of your feature coefficients. Applying the penalty has the effect of generalizing the model to new data, but sometimes lowering the training accuracy. L2 regularization, or Ridge, is the most common for preventing overfitting. L1 regularization has the possibility to remove features from the data, and is better for extremely large datasets. Regularization comes with the need to tune the λ hyperparameter, which is the stregnth of the penalty. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, regularization has the following work flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) Determine if regularization should be applied. Is there a discrepancy in training and testing accuracy? \n",
    "    2) Which type to use? Is the model overfit? How big is the dataset? \n",
    "    3) Tune λ, the strength of the regularization to optimize testing accuracy. "
